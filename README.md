1. **Install Dependencies**:

   NutriPal has separate frontend (client) and backend (server) components, each requiring its own set of dependencies. Follow these steps to ensure all required packages are installed for both parts of the application:

   - **Client Dependencies**:
     - Navigate to the client directory:
       ```bash
       cd client
       ```
     - Install the necessary packages for the frontend:
       ```bash
       npm install
       ```
     - This command will download and install all dependencies listed in the `client/package.json` file, including libraries needed for React Native, UI components, and mobile-specific tools.

   - **Server Dependencies**:
     - Open a new terminal window or tab, then navigate to the server directory:
       ```bash
       cd server
       ```
     - Install the necessary packages for the backend:
       ```bash
       npm install
       ```
     - This command will install all dependencies specified in the `server/package.json` file, including packages for handling API requests, database connections, authentication, and any utility libraries used on the server side.

   - **Verify Installation**:
     - Once both installations are complete, check for any warnings or errors. Dependencies should be installed without issues in both directories for the application to work correctly.
   
   **Note**: If using a monorepo setup, you can install dependencies across both directories simultaneously by running:
   ```bash
   npm install --workspaces

2.	**Environment Variables**: Set up environment variables for sensitive data like API keys and database credentials.
-  **Create a `.env` File** in the root directory of both the `client` and `server` (if necessary), create a file named `.env`. This file will hold all sensitive configuration details that should not be hardcoded into the codebase.
- **Add Your Environment Variables** in the `.env` file, define the following variables. Update the placeholder values with actual credentials and settings:


	```bash
	# Database Configuration
   DB_USER=         # Database username (e.g., postgres or root)
   DB_PASSWORD=     # Database password for the user
   DB_NAME=nutripal # Name of the database created for NutriPal
   DB_SCHEMA=nutripal # Default schema to use within the database
   DB_HOST=         # Database server address (e.g., localhost or an IP address)
   
   # API Key for External Services
   GEMINI_API_KEY=  # API key for the Gemini service used in NutriPal's RAG framework

   # Server Configuration
   PORT=            # Port on which the backend server should run (e.g., 3000)
	```

3.	**Database**: Configure PostgreSQL as the primary database. Ensure the database is up and running before proceeding to run server.
- **Install Database Software**: If you haven‚Äôt already, install PostgreSQL or MySQL:
     - **PostgreSQL**: [Download PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)

- **Create the Database**: Open your database client (e.g., pgAdmin) or use the command line to create a new database for NutriPal. Replace placeholders with your preferred values.

   #### PostgreSQL
   ```bash
   # Log into PostgreSQL
   psql -U postgres

   # Create a new database
   CREATE DATABASE nutripal;

   # Create a new user and grant privileges
   CREATE USER nutripal_user WITH ENCRYPTED PASSWORD 'your_password';
   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE nutripal TO nutripal_user;

   # Optional: Connect to the newly created database
   \c nutripal;
   ````
- Initialize Sequelize: Set up Sequelize configuration in the config directory to match your .env settings.
```bash 
npx sequelize-cli init
```
- Run Migrations: Migrations are essential for setting up the tables and schema for NutriPal. Run the following command to apply migrations:
```bash
npx sequelize-cli db:migrate
```
3. **Running the Simulators:** To test NutriPal‚Äôs mobile app, set up the iOS and Android simulators with these steps. [iOS and Android Simulators](#ios-and-android-simulators)



4. **Run the App**: Instructions for running both frontend and backend servers.

   - **Frontend (Client)**:
     - Navigate to the client folder:
       ```bash
       cd client
       ```
     - Run the frontend application. If using React Native, you can specify the platform (e.g., iOS or Android):
       ```bash
       npm run ios    # For iOS simulator (macOS only)
       npm run android # For Android emulator or connected Android device
       ```
     - This will start the mobile app on your specified emulator or connected device, allowing you to test the NutriPal client interface.

   - **Backend (Server)**:
     - Open a new terminal window, then navigate to the server folder:
       ```bash
       cd server
       ```
     - Start the backend server by running:
       ```bash
       node index.js
       ```
     - This command will initialize the server, which will handle API requests and communicate with the database. Make sure any necessary environment variables are set up before running the server.
   
   - **Testing the Connection**:
     - After both servers are running, verify the frontend and backend are connected. Open the app in the simulator and perform a simple action that requires data from the backend, such as logging in or retrieving a sample meal plan.
   
   **Note**: Ensure that your `.env` files are correctly configured in both the client and server folders, and that the backend server URL is correctly set in the frontend configuration.


## üöÄ Deployment Instructions

To deploy NutriPal, ensure the following steps are completed for a smooth setup in both development and production environments.

### 1. üóÑÔ∏è Database Setup
   - **Run Migrations**: Migrate the database schema to set up tables and relationships in your production database (e.g., PostgreSQL or MySQL). This step is crucial for structuring NutriPal‚Äôs data correctly in production.
   - Run the following command in your server directory:
     ```bash
     npx sequelize-cli db:migrate
     ```
   - **Verify Database Connection**: Ensure your production database is running and that environment variables (`DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD`, `DB_NAME`, `DB_HOST`) are correctly configured in the `.env` file.

### 2. üì¶ Build and Start the Server
   - **Development Mode**:
     - To start the server in development mode, which includes hot-reloading for easier debugging, run:
       ```bash
